## 📱 About the apps

**My USSD Codes** is a small utility app for Android and iOS built around three sections (bottom navigation):

1. **Sections** — codes grouped by category and by the user's own fully-customizable groups.
2. **All codes** — a flat, searchable list of every code on the device.
3. **Settings** — import collections from this catalog, manage data, and app info.

Besides importing collections from this repository, users can **create their own codes** with a bit of logic: codes may declare **variables** (placeholders such as `{number}`) that the app asks for right before dialing.

## 📋 Collection format

Each collection is a single JSON file inside `codes/`, registered in `codes/index.json` and validated against [`schema/collection.schema.json`](schema/collection.schema.json):

```json
{
  "id": "example-carrier",
  "name": "Example Carrier",
  "description": "Prepaid balance and data codes for Example Carrier.",
  "version": 1,
  "country": "US",
  "carrier": "Example",
  "codes": [
    {
      "id": "example-balance",
      "name": "Check balance",
      "description": "Shows the current prepaid balance.",
      "code": "*111#",
      "category": "Balance",
      "tags": ["balance", "prepaid"]
    },
    {
      "id": "example-transfer",
      "name": "Transfer credit",
      "description": "Transfers credit to another line.",
      "code": "*234*{number}*{amount}#",
      "category": "Balance",
      "variables": [
        { "key": "number", "label": "Destination number", "type": "phone" },
        { "key": "amount", "label": "Amount to transfer", "type": "number" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 🔤 Variables

A code may embed placeholders written as `{key}`. Every placeholder must be declared in `variables` (and vice versa). Supported types: `text`, `number`, `phone`. The apps prompt for each variable before dialing.

### ⚠️ Dangerous codes

Codes that can lock a SIM, erase settings or cost money must set `"dangerous": true` (the apps show a warning before running them) and should explain the risk in `notes`.

## ✅ Validation

No dependencies needed — plain Node.js (18+):

```bash
node scripts/validate.js
```

CI runs the same script on every push and pull request.

## 📥 Importing into the app

The apps read raw files straight from this repository, e.g.:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertolicea00/my-ussd-codes/main/codes/gsm-standard.json
```

Paste a collection URL in **Settings → Import** inside the app.

## 🤝 Contributing

New codes and collections are very welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Every submitted code needs a source and, ideally, confirmation that it was tested on a real device.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

USSD codes are executed by your carrier, not by the apps. Codes vary by country, carrier and plan; some may be paid services. Always double-check a code before running it. This project and its contributors are not responsible for charges or side effects caused by dialing any code.
